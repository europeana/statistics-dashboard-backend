# Statistics Dashboard Backend

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/europeana/statistics-dashboard-backend.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/europeana/statistics-dashboard-backend)

A utility for Europeana API data.

## Getting started

Make sure you have `java` version 21 and `maven` version 3.6.x:

    java -version
    mvn -v

Rename and update the example properties file: `statistics-dashboard-rest/src/main/resources/application.properties.example`

    mongo.hosts=localhost
    mongo.port=27017
    ...

Install the dependencies and build the asset:

    mvn package

## Development server (swagger)

Run the built asset:

  java -jar ./statistics-dashboard-rest/target/statistics-dashboard-rest-6-SNAPSHOT.jar

and navigate to [http://localhost:4280/](http://localhost:4280/).

## Branches and Pull Requests

The main branch for development is the `develop` branch. But do NOT use this branch directly! Use a new branch for features/bugs and give it a descriptive name containing the user story code, like:

    feat/MET-1535-chart-styling
    bug/MET-3245-dashboard-not-loading

If you push a branch or commit to GitHub, it will automatically be tested by Travis CI. This will take about 5 mins and the results will be shown in GitHub, e.g. in the pull request page.

Make a pull request in GitHub for code review and merging.

## Running unit tests

To run the unit tests use the command:

    mvn test
